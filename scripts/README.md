## sync-external-docs.py

Sync generated documentation outputs from external repos into a destination root.

Currently supported repos are listed in the script's `REPO_DOCS` whitelist.

```shell
$ python3 scripts/sync-external-docs.py --output-root /tmp/website-stage
Building docs in /path/to/optional with: make docs
Copying /path/to/optional/docs/html to /tmp/website-stage/static/optional

# Override the parent folder containing external repos
$ python3 scripts/sync-external-docs.py --repos-root ../ --output-root /tmp/website-stage

# In CI: clone missing repos and update them before syncing docs
$ python3 scripts/sync-external-docs.py --repos-root /tmp/beman-external --clone-missing --update-repos --output-root /tmp/website-stage
```

## run-staged-website.py

Prepare a temporary staged MkDocs content tree, overlay generated library docs, then run MkDocs against that staged content.

By default this uses a persistent temporary workspace rooted at:

```shell
$TMPDIR/beman-website-work/
```

Its final staged source tree lives at:

```shell
$TMPDIR/beman-website-work/site/
```

Its final rendered artifacts live in the local `build/` `gh-pages` worktree by default:

```shell
/path/to/website/build/
```

If `build/` already exists as a legacy non-worktree directory, the script warns and asks before deleting and replacing it.

```shell
$ python3 scripts/run-staged-website.py start
$ python3 scripts/run-staged-website.py build
$ python3 scripts/run-staged-website.py serve
```

`make` and `make start` are equivalent and both go through this staged workflow.

## publish-gh-pages.sh

Publish an existing `gh-pages` worktree to the remote `gh-pages` branch.

```shell
$ bash scripts/publish-gh-pages.sh gh-pages
$ bash scripts/publish-gh-pages.sh gh-pages /tmp/custom-gh-pages-worktree
```
