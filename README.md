# The Beman Project Website

This is the repository hosting the code for the future Beman Website: https://bemanproject.org/.

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
Documentation is written in MDX format.
Building and deploying it requires Node and NPM.

## Add a blog post

1. Repository setup: `create a local clone` or `open in Codespaces`.

2. Create a directory having an `index.md` file using this pattern: `blog/YYYY-MM-DD-tile-of-post/index.md`:

Example:

```shell
$ tree blog/2000-10-30-my-blog-example/
blog/2000-10-30-my-blog-example/
├── images
│   └── beman_logo.png # images are stored in ./images/
└── index.md           # actual blog post content

2 directories, 2 files
```

3. Add your full Markdown blog post content inside the `index.md` file.

Example

```shell
$ cat blog/2000-10-30-my-blog-example/index.md
---
slug: my-blog-example-slug    # Slug example. Remove this comment if using this template.
authors: [neatudarius]        # Authors list with entrie from blog/authors.yml. Remove this comment if using this template.
tags: ["cpp26", "beman-docs"] # Blog post valid tags from blog/tags.yml. Remove this comment if using this template.
comments: true                # If comments should be enabled for this blog post. Default: true.
---

# My Blog Example

This is my blog example.

Here I can write Markdown content.

<details>
<summary> Add the author if not already present in blog/authors.yml  </summary>

If this is your first time writing a blog post, you have to add yourself as an author in the `blog/authors.yml` file. Add a new entry using the following format:

```shell
<AuthorTag>:    # Your author tag, this is what you will use in the header section for a log.
name:           # Your Real Name.
title:          # Your title, how do you want to be recognized by other people.
url:            # Your Github profile page
image_url:      # A url for your profile image (for Github profile image: go to your profile, click on your image and open it in a new tab, copy the link).
page: true      # If an author page should be generated for you.
socials:        # [optional] Include your socials (like your Github, X, Linkedin etc)
    github: <yourId>      # [optional] Add GitHub page.
    linkedin: <yourId>    # [optional] Add LinkedIn page.
    x: <yourId>           # [optional] Add X page.
```

> Note: The Discourse comments plugin only works for production website (a.k.a. https://bemanproject.org/). You cannot test it locally or on preview deployments. Check [Integrate Discourse comment feature for blog posts](https://github.com/bemanproject/website/issues/25) for more details.

4. Open a `DRAFT PR` and `wait` up to one minute for a preview deployment of your blog post.

- Draft PR example: [Add blog post: My Blog Example #54](https://github.com/bemanproject/website/pull/54/).

- Click on the `Deploy Preview` URL (format `https://deploy-preview-${PR NUMBER}--bemanproject.netlify.app/`).

- Successful CI preview deployment example:

![CI preview deployment success message](./images/tutorial/add-a-blog/ci-preview-deployment-success-message.gif)

- Test your deployment.

<details>
<summary> [DEBUG] Inspect CI preview deployment error logs. </summary>

The CI preview deployment logs should be public. Please ping a codeowner otherwise.

- `DRAFT` PR example with CI preview deployment error - [#49](https://github.com/bemanproject/website/pull/49).

- Click on the `Latest deploy log` URL - e.g., https://app.netlify.com/sites/bemanproject/deploys/6809108974fd910008633aa9.

- Logs inspect example:

![CI preview deployment failure message](./images/tutorial/add-a-blog/ci-preview-deployment-failure-message.gif)

- Fix the error, commit and push the changes. Wait for new deployment.

> If you need to browse through more recent CI preview deployments logs use https://app.netlify.com/sites/bemanproject/deploys/. Note: netlify provides a single a single CI preview deployment for each PR - latest commit, but stores logs for multiple ones.

</details>

<details>
<summary> [DEBUG] Inspect local deployment error logs. </summary>

- On local setup, run `make` (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#development)) and check if there is any error in the console - example:

```shell
$ make
...
[INFO] Starting the development server...
...
[ERROR] Error: Processing of blog source file path=2000-10-30-my-blog-example/index.md failed.

  [cause]: Error: Blog author with key "neatudarius" not found in the authors map file.
  Valid author keys are:
  - JeffGarland
  - dabrahams
  - DavidSankel
```

- Fix the error, re-deploy the local website.

- Commit and push the changes. Wait for a new CI preview deployment.

</details>

5. After you got `a succesful CI preview deployment`, update the PR to be ready for review and add [@leads](https://github.com/orgs/bemanproject/teams/leads) /[@core-reviewers](https://github.com/orgs/bemanproject/teams/core-reviewers).

6. Apply the review feedback. Get approval. Merge the PR.

<!-- TODO: Replace with https://www.bemanproject.org/ after the website deployment switch. -->

7. The updates are automatically deployed to the production website after a few minutes - check https://bemanproject.github.io/website/.

## Development

Local setup, dependencies, and running the site: see **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#development)**.

`make` and `make start` are equivalent: both install dependencies, prepare the staged external docs inputs, ensure the local `build/` worktree exists, and then start the Docusaurus development server.

## Automated `gh-pages` publishing

GitHub Actions publishes this site to the `gh-pages` branch on:

- pushes to `main`
- a 6-hour schedule (`0 */6 * * *`)
- manual dispatch

```shell
$ python3 scripts/run-staged-website.py build --repos-root /tmp/beman-external --clone-missing --update-repos
```

For builds published from a fork or any GitHub Pages project site, set the site
URL and base URL to match the repository path. Example:

```shell
$ BEMAN_SITE_URL="https://<your_username>.github.io" \
  BEMAN_BASE_URL="/beman-website/" \
  BEMAN_GITHUB_ORG="<your_username>" \
  BEMAN_GITHUB_REPO="beman-website" \
  python3 scripts/run-staged-website.py build --repos-root ..
```
